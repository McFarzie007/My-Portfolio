<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><h3>Forest Gump</h3></li>
<p>It's a wonderful emotional movie full of poignance. It's arguably my best performance of Tom Hank.</p>
<li><h3>Beast of No Nation</h3></li>
<P>This is a masterpiece action and survival movie that I could keep watching over and over again without getting bored. It's a movies based of revolution and rebellion in Africa. Being an African, I find it relatable and interesting. It's arguably one of the movies that put Africa movie production on world map.</P>
<li><h3>Jagun Jagun</h3></li>
<P>This a great action movie from  my home country/tribe (Nigeria/Yoruba) which makes me so proud because of it's standard and the professionalism that was put into the production. This shows that we are capable of making movies like other advance part of the world. I find myself in immense excitement anytime I watch it. Even it's just a movie, it's what I would like to call Africa's version of Starz's Spartacus TV Show</P></ul>
